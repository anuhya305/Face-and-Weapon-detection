**Face and Weapon Detection** is a security-focused AI system that leverages computer vision to identify human faces and detect potential weapons (e.g., guns, knives) in real-time video streams or images. The goal is to enhance surveillance systems, alert security personnel, and improve safety in public and restricted areas.

This project can be integrated with CCTV systems, drones, or mobile devices for real-time threat detection.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-and-weapon-detection.git
cd face-and-weapon-detection
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Download or place your detection models
Place your pre-trained YOLO or Haar Cascade models into the models/ directory.

5. Run the application
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py

🖼️ Usage

Run the script and choose between image or video input.

The system will display the media with bounding boxes around detected faces and weapons.

Detected threats can trigger alerts or be logged.

📊 Sample Output

  Faces are marked with green bounding boxes.

  Weapons are marked with red bounding boxes.

  Labels (e.g., "Face", "Gun", "Knife") appear with confidence scores.

🧩 Future Improvements

  Multi-camera support

  Weapon type classification

  Integration with databases for facial recognition

  Real-time alerting system (SMS, Email, App)
